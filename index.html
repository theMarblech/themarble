<h1>Welcome! - It's safe here!</h1>
<h2>You've come across the site of a bored teenager who is sitting in his room 12 hours a day (slighty exaggerated) :P
 <p> I run the 'theMarble' YouTube channel where we do computer experiments.
   <p> For a background on me, I've been making videos since 2014 and have used computers my whole life. I love Linux,<br>
     the Macintosh, and everything to do with programming and motion graphics. I've been taking up an aspiration of professional video editing<br>
     for almost 2 years now.
